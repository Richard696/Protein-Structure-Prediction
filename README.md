# Protein-Structure-Prediction
This is my personal machine learning exercise based on kaggle protein dataset

## What I learnt
This project, I learnt how to clean data, mapping the value with the dictionary, lightgbm, catboost and neural network. And also hyperparameter tuning.


## Dataset is too large to upload
