# Protein-Structure-Prediction
This is a mini machine learning project based on kaggle protein dataset. The `EDA_v2.py` contain the code on data analysis and data cleaning, while `ML_V2.py` contain the code for creating machine learning model.


## Implemented
- clean data 
- mapping the value with the dictionary 
- machine learning model
  - lightgbm
  - catboost 
  - neural network. 
  - hyperparameter tuning.

## Require dependency
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn
- sklearn
- keras
- tensorflow
- lightgbm
- catboost

## Regarding Dataset 
Due to the dataset is more than 5 mb in which exceed the limit of Github, hence the [link of the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shahir/protein-data-set)
